# SkipList C++ Implementation
This is simple implementation of C++ skip list, aim at learning the mechanism under this data structure.

This implementation also implement a naive comparator and allow compare any type (include self-defined).

## To do list
- [x] Single thread skiplist
- [x] Add simple test for insert and delete
- [ ] Add scale test
- [ ] Support multi-thread skiplist, make it thread-safe
- [ ] Add multi-thread tests to test its concurrency
